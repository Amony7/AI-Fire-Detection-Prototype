### Real-time Fire Detection Prototype
Real-time fire detection system that generates a dashboards for 10 cameras simultaneously, detects a fire, and  automatically sends an alert that indicates the timestamp, confidence and location (camera ID) of the fire.


### üõ†Ô∏è  Installation

1. Install YOLOv8
```
pip install ultralytics
```
```
from ultralytics import YOLO

```

### üèãÔ∏è Training

/Fire-Prototype.ipynb was set up for the training and deployment of the model. For training, a Kaggle fire dataset was downloaded and saved in the /data folder.

A .yaml file was created to read the data and use it for training.

+ .yaml file
    ```
    yaml_content = """
    train: data/train/images
    val:   data/valid/images
    test:  data/test/images


    nc: 1
    names: ['fire']
    """
    ```
    ```
    with open("fire.yaml", "w") as f:
        f.write(yaml_content)
    ```

A  YOLOv8 nano model was chosen as the base model and  fine-tuned using the fire dataset. The model was trained with 100 epochs of 8 image batches with imgsz 640. A large [dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/situational-awarnessinnovsense/fire-detection-ypseh) of almost 10,000 images was used. The dataset can be found here 

+ Train
    ```
  model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
    results = model.train(
    data = "fire1.yaml",
    epochs = 100,
    imgsz = 640,
    batch = 8
)
