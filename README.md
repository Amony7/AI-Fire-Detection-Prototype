### Real-time Fire Detection Prototype
Real-time fire detection system that generates a dashboards for 10 cameras simultaneously, detects a fire, and  automatically sends an alert that indicates the timestamp, confidence and location (camera ID) of the fire.


### üõ†Ô∏è  Installation

1. Install YOLOv8
```
pip install ultralytics
```
```
from ultralytics import YOLO

```

### üèãÔ∏è Training

/Fire-Prototype.ipynb was set up for the training and deployment of the model. For training, a Kaggle fire dataset was downloaded and saved in the /data folder.

A .yaml file was created to read the data and use it for training.

+ .yaml file
    ```
    yaml_content = """
    train: data/train/images
    val:   data/valid/images
    test:  data/test/images


    nc: 1
    names: ['fire']
    """
    ```
    ```
    with open("fire.yaml", "w") as f:
        f.write(yaml_content)
    ```

A  YOLOv8 nano model was chosen as the base model and  fine-tuned using the fire dataset. The model was trained with 25 epochs of 16 image batches with imgsz 640.

+ Train
    ```
    model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
    results = model.train(
    data = "fire.yaml",
    epochs = 100,
    imgsz = 640,
    batch = 16
)


Due to low accuracy and undesirable results, the model was further trained with 100 epochs.
```
model = YOLO("runs/detect/train6/weights/best.pt")
results = model.train(
    data = "fire.yaml",
    epochs = 100,
    imgsz = 640,
    batch = 16
)
```



The results and their comparisons will be shown below.
